By Tantan on <a href="https://mingofhope.github.io/yi-ming.github.io/">July 20, 2022 at 1:24 PM</a>, 
we were acquainted. Since I am a nerd and have no concept of holidays, 
birthdays, or weddings, some folks unexpectedly but logically just got
off my bus heading for the end of life. Depression surrounds me until 
I meet you. Hot but gentle, liberal but reserved, and slow in
love. I'm so moved to know someone like you that I can't help but write
down some things to capture the moment, which I truly, really love.  
I don't consider how far we can go or if we are old enough to love each 
other; instead, my overwhelming, indescribably romantic emotion of love 
merely dictates that. If you would want to learn more about me, I would 
be happy to share my heart and let go of those burdens. I merely wish 
to be understood. Though it seems cruel, I ask that you wait patiently 
to read everything before deciding whether or not to accept me.

Today is the one we have meet for 28 days. When I was returning home from your apartment on the train, I unintentionally received your block for all interaction. In the waning moments, we give each other hugs, kisses, and smiles. I'm currently sitting in the dark trying to remember what is wrong with me as the night sings. No response. Only silence. External silence.
We both have the good nature to encourage one another to grow. If I have to come up with a justification for this tragedy tale, I might realize that I am in too much of a rush to improve our relationship. So fast that I do not have a reason to keep you, while I hope I have. I miss your warm embrace, the feel of your lips, and the aroma of your undivided love. Unfortunately,
I will lose all of them without any exeuctable explanations. I do not want to emphasize your courage for love, your support for a pitiful soul, or your faith in my eagerness since I will always treasure those qualities that can only be seen in books or novels. This can be a part of life - to live, to give up, but to hold on. I appreciate the short-term energy you provided to quell my anxiety, and I will use it to expand my long-term creativity. Allow me to share the final three tales with you, speak in the most neutral tone possible, and keep in mind who I truly am.
