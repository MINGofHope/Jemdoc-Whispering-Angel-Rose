Life is a journey that requires a positive attitude and determination. To keep track of my progress along the way, I find it important to document my experiences. Through recording my journey, I can reflect on my challenges, successes, and lessons learned. This allows me to continuously grow and improve. No matter what difficulties I may face, I strive to stay positive and focus on the happiness that comes with achieving my goals.

From my perspective, an ideal man should possess knowledge in various fields such as history, psychology, finance, and their major. History inspires critical thinking and helps one understand the limitations of individual life. Psychology is helpful in dealing with hardships and encourages a positive outlook on life. Finance provides valuable knowledge on how to make money work for you, and major knowledge allows one to stand out in their field and turn theory into practical products.

Learning with curiosity and a shared philosophy is essential for personal and professional growth. By constantly seeking knowledge and new experiences, I am able to broaden my perspectives and continuously improve myself. I believe that through hard work and dedication, anyone can achieve their goals and live a fulfilling life.
