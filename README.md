Life is like an angel. If you whisper to her in a rosy way, she will mirror as the same. This stimulates me to record my progress along the way to the end. No hesitation, but dertermination. No pain, but happiness. 

An ideal man, from my perspective, should possess knowledge with history, psychology, finance and major. History inspires people for critical thinking under various settings to get rid of the limitations of short life of an individual. The valuable lessons from the thinking applies to dealing with people same today. Psychology works exactly when you are struggling from a hardship. Once you know how it work, you will know how to comfort yourself and be positive to your life. If the former two kinds of knowledge are helpful for the spirit, the the rest two, will be benifical for your material. Finance teaches you how to make the money work for you. You will learn how to invest in a much more smart and balanced way. Where does the money for investment comes from? Your major knowledge. Stand out on your field, and make the formula you learned into a practical product. 

Always learn with curiosity, and shared philosophy.
