= Love - Ding Yi & Yanming

{{<div align="justify">
By Tantan on <a href="https://mingofhope.github.io/yi-ming.github.io/">July 20, 2022 at 1:24 PM</a>, 
we were acquainted. Since I am a nerd and have no concept of holidays, 
birthdays, or weddings, some folks unexpectedly but logically just got
off my bus heading for the end of life. Depression surrounds me until 
I meet you. Hot but gentle, liberal but reserved, and slow in
love. I'm so moved to know someone like you that I can't help but write
down some things to capture the moment, which I truly, really love.  
I don't consider how far we can go or if we are old enough to love each 
other; instead, my overwhelming, indescribably romantic emotion of love 
merely dictates that. If you would want to learn more about me, I would 
be happy to share my heart and let go of those burdens. I merely wish 
to be understood. Though it seems cruel, I ask that you wait patiently 
to read everything before deciding whether or not to accept me.

== Goals
- Simple, consistent syntax.
- $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ [latex.html equation support].
- [tables.html Table support].
- Portability. The (single) jemdoc [http://www.python.org/ Python] file \+
  single css file \+ your input file {{&rarr;}} html.
- Based on [http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ CSS] so formatting specifics are
  independent of jemdoc.
- Production of clean,
  [http://validator.w3.org/check/referer
  standards-compliant] [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/ XHTML 1.1].
- Minimal bells and whistles, but simple fallback to raw html if required.
